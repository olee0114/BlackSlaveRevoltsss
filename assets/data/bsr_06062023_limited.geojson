(Image 1) The rebellion began when a group of about 20 enslaved Africans, led by Jemmy, from Angola/Congo, gathered near the Stono River, south of Charleston, and stole weapons from a store. (Image 2) They then marched south towards Florida, where they hoped to find freedom, beating drums, and shouting \"liberty!\" along the way, and recruited other slaves to join them. As they marched, others joined them, with their number swelling to over 100.

This occurrence remained utmost in the minds of the enslaved. The period of the French Revolution in Saint Lucia was the most tumultuous in the history of the island and of Soufriere. Everyone rallied to the slogan, Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité for different reasons. Soufriere became the headquarters of the \"Patriotes\" the Revolutionary Party. The British attempted to seize the colony from the French in 1795, and were met by the Patriotes, made up of radical French, Africans, and Indigenous people. The Africans also took advantage of that time to fight for their freedom. (Image 3) A mulatto woman, Flore Bois Gaillard a.k.a Piton Flore, was a principal strategist in the Battle of Rabot or Brigands war. She teamed up with a group of newly freed slaves, the Brigands, to defeat the British through guerilla tactics. The Battle of Rabot, one of the critical events of the \"Brigands War\" was fought on April 22, 1795. The souvenir sheet shows the forces' disposition and the battle plan. (Image 2) The British from Castries landed over a thousand troops at Vieux Fort and marched them overland to Soufriere. They attacked on April 22 at Fond Doux and Rabot. A crucial battle took place on that day, proving the Brigands‚Äô military tactics and prowess so they could hold on to the town of Soufriere. However, destruction was widespread, as whites were attacked and the estates torched. (Image 4) Seven of the eleven towns and villages were destroyed.

The Royalist planters fled with them, leaving the remaining Saint Lucians to enjoy \"l‚ÄôAnnée de la Liberté\", \"a year of freedom from slavery‚Ä¶\" The war ended in November 1797 with an agreement by the British that the Brigands would not be re-enslaved but repatriated to Africa.

          "encoded_description": "<img src=\"/image1\"> In 1791, some of the enslaved had requested their liberty and were met with violence, the men were decapitated, and the women and children also received harsh punishment. This occurrence remained utmost in the minds of the enslaved. The period of the French Revolution in Saint Lucia was the most tumultuous in the history of the island and of Soufriere. Everyone rallied to the slogan, Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité for different reasons. Soufriere became the headquarters of the \"Patriotes\" the Revolutionary Party. The British attempted to seize the colony from the French in 1795, and were met by the Patriotes, made up of radical French, Africans, and Indigenous people. The Africans also took advantage of that time to fight for their freedom. <img src=\"/image3\"> A mulatto woman, Flore Bois Gaillard a.k.a Piton Flore, was a principal strategist in the Battle of Rabot or Brigands war. She teamed up with a group of newly freed slaves, the Brigands, to defeat the British through guerilla tactics. The Battle of Rabot, one of the critical events of the \"Brigands War\" was fought on April 22, 1795. The souvenir sheet shows the forces' disposition and the battle plan. <img src=\"/image2\"> The British from Castries landed over a thousand troops at Vieux Fort and marched them overland to Soufriere. They attacked on April 22 at Fond Doux and Rabot. A crucial battle took place on that day, proving the Brigands' military tactics and prowess so they could hold on to the town of Soufriere. However, destruction was widespread, as whites were attacked and the estates torched. <img src=\"/image4\"> Seven of the eleven towns and villages were destroyed. Castries and Soufriere, and Gros Islet were spared. The English withdrew to Castriesand were eventually defeated, fleeing the island. The Royalist planters fled with them, leaving the remaining Saint Lucians to enjoy \"l'Année de la Liberté\", \"a year of freedom from slavery‚Ä¶\" The war ended in November 1797 with an agreement by the British that the Brigands would not be re-enslaved but repatriated to Africa.

Garbriel was literate and a skilled Blacksmith, probably a skill he learned from his father. Although well acquainted with Christianity and the bible, he did not become a minister. His skills afforded him the ability to be hired out in Richmond, Virginia. Gabriel was informed by the politics of the day, the discontent between the political parties and the aftermath of the French Revolution with the calls of equality, fraternity and democracy. Prosser chose a Saturday as a large number of Blacks going into town would not alert the slave patrollers. HIs plan was to organize free and enslaved Blacks, \"...march on Richmond under a flag reading 'Death or Liberty'\", seize the city's armory and force the planters to release their slaves. It rained that day so the revolt was postponed to the next day, long enough for one of the slaves to change his mind and alert the officials. Twenty-seven Blacks were executed including Gabriel's two brothers.",

The repression left Recife and gained importance to exterminate the supposed quilombo where \"seeds of sedition\" germinated. In 1816, the material was searched, resulting in the imprisonment of 37 blacks (with several nations: ussá, fulani, haussá and some \"from Costa da Mina\") and 1 white man.

The slaves demanded a three-day holiday and enquired when they would be set free (insert image 1); the manager refused to assure them, so they set the estate on fire. The rebellion was led by Emmanuel, an enslaved laborer on a plantation in the island's southern region.

He abhorred slavery and was able to plan the most extensive revolt in history that had approximmately 9,000 slaves involved. He warned his combatants to not tell any house slaves, ofcourse one did and the revolt was foiled. The plan was to attack six points simultaneously,\"... take control of military strongholds: arsenals, guardhouses, powder magazines, and naval stores...kill as many whites as possible (including women and children).

Unlike previous slave revolts -- led by alliances between free people of color and slaves, blacks and mulattoes, Africans and Creoles, and rural and urban populations -- only African-born men organized the uprising of 1825. From this year onwards, Barcia argues, slave uprisings in Cuba underwent a phase of Africanization that concluded only in the mid-1840s with the conspiracy of La Escalera, a large movement organized by free colored men with ample participation of the slave population. In 1826, several slaves rebelled in Guira.",

          "description": "Nat Turner revolt is the most well known of all. At the height of the revolt, 50 slaves were involved as they traveled from plantation to plantation killing approximately 60 men, women and children mostly through decapitation. As they made their way to Jerusalem the recruits wanted to rest and disbanded it was this uncalculated move that gave the local militias the opportunity to attack. Nat's band had decreased to no more than thirty where they stopped to rest, the next morning they attacked Belmont where the rest of Turner's force was dispersed. Nat Turner found himself alone and retuned to the Travis plantation where the rebellion began-it took two months for the authorities to locate him, he was hanged and skinned. (the skins of Black people were used to make book covers, belts and wallets-also used as souvenirs) In retaliation, over 200 Blacks were killed, many had never even heard of Nat Turner. As a result, petitions to end slavery poured into the Virginia legislature instead of abolition the \"lawmakers passed harsher laws making the lives of the slaves even worst\"",

The Spanish authorities brutally suppressed the rebellion who executed hundreds of rebels and suspected sympathizers. The term \"Year of the Lash\" generally refers to the harsh response toward the would-be uprising by Cuban authorities. Thousands of Afro-Cubans (both slave and free) were executed, imprisoned, or banished from the island. The targeted leaders of the conspiracies were primarily artists, politically astute persons, and artisans, including carpenters, blacksmiths, and shoemakers, who had some degree of education and social mobility.

Many left the plantations and settled their own farms or merchant enterprises. The Morant Bay Rebellion was initiated by a group of Afro-Jamaicans who had been freed from slavery in the 1830's and had settled on land owned by a white. Litigation ensued and the Afro-Jamaicans were told they had to bear the court costs. Enraged, they returned to the land in question and squatted. Reverend Paul Bogle got involved in the protest, that led to the courthouse being burned down and the looting of properties. Hysteria from previous revolts loomed so what began \"...as a local protest concerning taxes and larceny resulted in the death of 350 toilers, the executions of Paul Bogle and George William Gordon on charges of sedition and the termination of local government.

          "description": "(image 1)Up until it was briefly held by Italy in 1931 to 1945, Ethiopia was the only African territory that resisted complete colonization by Europeans. Italy did indeed colonize part of ancient Ethiopia, the area along the Red Sea that became known as the independent country, Eritrea. However, under the leadership of Emperor Menelik II, Ethiopia resisted European attempts to colonize all of the country.(image 2) Ethiopia won a decisive victory over Italy at the Battle of Adowa in December 1895. During the battle, Menelik‚Äôs warriors attacked with a ferocity the Italians couldn‚Äôt have imagined. Taking hardly any prisoners, the victors of Battle of Adowa killed 289 Italian officers, 2,918 European soldiers and about 2,000 Askari (Africans who fought on the side of Europeans). Another 954 European troops were missing, while 470 Italians and 958 Askari were wounded. Some 700 Italians and 1,800 Askari fell into the hands of the Ethiopian troops.
