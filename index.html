    <h2 class="textbox" style="max-width: 1000px">This is unplanned it really just happens. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Happy painting, God bless. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. I like to beat the brush. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing.</h2>
